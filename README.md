- led a group working on a Bitcoin price prediction project utilizing sophisticated techniques including XGBoost, LSTM, and ARIMA models on a dataset obtained from Yahoo Finance that covered the years 2014â€“2022. 
- For improved analysis, feature engineering was used, and market indicators were investigated. 
- XGBoost and LSTM were surpassed in forecasting accuracy by the ARIMA model. contributed knowledge in data modeling, data engineering, machine learning, and financial analysis while adhering to an organized CRISP-DM process.
